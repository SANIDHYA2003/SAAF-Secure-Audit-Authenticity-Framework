## SECTION 4: UNIFIED PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

### KEY CONCEPT: Single Blockchain, Multiple Actors

**LIKE COLLEGE PORTAL:**
- Single database (MongoDB)
- Multiple login roles (Student, Teacher, Admin)
- Role-based dashboards
- Same data, different views

**LIKE VERIFYCHIAN:**
- Single blockchain (Ethereum)
- Multiple actor roles (Manufacturer, Distributor, Transporter, Pharmacy)
- Role-based dashboards
- Same immutable ledger, different access permissions

### NO SEPARATE CHAINS PER COMPANY ❌

Why? Because:
- ❌ Can't track cross-company transfers
- ❌ Counterfeiters could fake their own chain
- ❌ No end-to-end transparency
- ❌ Defeats purpose of blockchain
- ❌ Too expensive (multiple networks)

### YES TO SINGLE SHARED CHAIN ✅

Benefits:
- ✅ Complete supply chain transparency
- ✅ Immutable from manufacturer to patient
- ✅ Cryptographically secure
- ✅ No single point of control
- ✅ Low cost
- ✅ Real-time verification

### HOW ROLE-BASED ACCESS WORKS:

```
Blockchain (Public, immutable):
├─ All transactions recorded
├─ Anyone can read any block
└─ Only authorized address can write

Database (Private, role-based):
├─ Users collection stores roles
├─ JWT tokens identify user
├─ API checks permissions
└─ Only allowed actions execute

Dashboard (Role-specific UI):
├─ Manufacturer sees "Create Batch"
├─ Distributor sees "Accept Batch"
├─ Transporter sees "Track Shipment"
├─ Pharmacy sees "Accept Delivery"
└─ Public sees "Verify Authenticity" (no login)
```

```
Block #1: BatchCreated
├─ Who: Manufacturer (Cipla Mumbai)
├─ What: Created batch B-202412-003
├─ When: 2024-12-01 10:00 AM

└─ Immutable: Cannot be changed, altered, or deleted

Block #2: BatchTransferred
├─ Who: Manufacturer (Cipla)
├─ What: Transferred batch to Distributor
├─ From: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc91e7d8e7f2D5 (Cipla)
├─ To: 0xAbc7aF4b6634C0532925a3b844Bc91e7d8e7f2D6 (MotilalOswal)
└─ Status change: CREATED → ASSIGNED_TO_DISTRIBUTOR

Block #3: DistributorAcceptedBatch
├─ Who: Distributor (MotilalOswal Pharma)
├─ What: Accepted batch from manufacturer
├─ QC Details: All seals intact, temp maintained ✓
├─ Warehouse: Warehouse A, Delhi
└─ Status change: ASSIGNED_TO_DISTRIBUTOR → AT_DISTRIBUTOR

[More blocks continue...]

Block #10: PharmacyAcceptedDelivery ⭐ CRITICAL
├─ Who: Pharmacy (City Pharmacy)
├─ What: Accepted delivery from distributor
├─ Ownership Transfer: Distributor → Pharmacy
├─ This is where OWNERSHIP changes on blockchain
└─ Status change: DELIVERY_COMPLETED → AT_PHARMACY
```

## SECTION 9: KEY DIFFERENCES: TRADITIONAL VS BLOCKCHAIN

### TRADITIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN:
```
Manufacturer → Distributor (paper/excel) → Transporter (phone call)
    ↓
❌ Easy to forge records
❌ Can't verify authenticity easily
❌ Disputes hard to resolve
❌ No real-time tracking
❌ Manual paperwork
❌ Centralized control
```

### VERIFYCHIAN (BLOCKCHAIN):
```
Manufacturer → Distributor (Block #1-3) → Transporter (Block #4-8)
    ↓
✅ Immutable records
✅ Instant verification via QR code
✅ Disputes resolved via blockchain proof
✅ Real-time GPS + temperature tracking
✅ Zero paperwork (all digital)
✅ Decentralized & transparent
✅ Customer trust restored
```
